		<description><![CDATA[The Java.next languages (Groovy, Scala, and Clojure) have more commonalities than differences, converging toward common ground in many of their features and conveniences. This installment explores how they each address a longstanding deficiency in the Java language -- the inability to overload operators. It also discusses the related concepts of associativity and precedence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regression and incremental tests play an important role during the testing 
of an application that might comprise hundreds or thousands of requirements. While the execution 
of incremental tests can sometimes be run manually, regression tests require an automation 
tool or framework. The support for multiple operating systems, architectures, and middleware 
software, like application servers and databases, make the necessity of an automation framework 
even more urgent. This article briefly introduces STAF/STAX test automation framework. It also  
shows how you can use it to build a framework for the automation of tests and continuous 
integration in a complex test bed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The primary purpose of writing characterization tests is to protect
    business functionality from inadvertent side-effects when difficult-to-change code
    needs to be modified. Untested or poorly tested legacy code can be complex, difficult to read, and not injectible -- all of which makes it hard to change when you need to. This article explains how to characterize such code properly for unit testing so that you can refactor it safely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Often, after a shared environment is provisioned, it&apos;s never decommissioned and might run for weeks or months, with engineers applying manual configuration changes throughout its lifetime. This risky approach regularly causes deployment problems and other strange &quot;environment&quot; errors to occur during development, test, and production cycles. This Agile DevOps installment explains how to create ephemeral environments that are terminated on a frequent basis. Once all environments are scripted and versioned, these test environments are only used long enough to run through a suite of tests as the software moves through a delivery pipeline on its way to production.]]></description>

                1: Get started with the default theme]]></title>
		
		<description><![CDATA[Creating an experience for multiple devices is essential, 
            but targeting the right set of devices can be challenging. 
            Responsive web design (RWD) has become a popular approach for creating a 
            single web site that optimizes content and layout automatically based on screen size, 
            device and orientation, eliminating the need to design for a specific user device preference. 
            This article discusses how to transform your WebSphere Portal theme into a 
            responsive web experience from the ground up. With advanced 
            CSS techniques, you can implement a theme that responds in real time to 
            different screen resolutions using flexible layouts and elastic elements.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actor concurrency has long been associated with the functional language
    Erlang. More recently, it has migrated to the JVM via languages such as Scala and
    Groovy, as well as Java-based implementation libraries and frameworks. With this
    knowledge path, you&apos;ll discover why actor concurrency is becoming an increasingly popular and necessary alternative to traditional Java concurrency. Learn the nuts and bolts of actors and the actor model, then try out a range of actor implementations, including GPars, Kilim, Akka, and the μJavaActors library.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Gang of Four&apos;s Interpreter design pattern encourages extending a language by building
a new language from it. Most functional languages let you extend the language in a variety
of ways, such as operator overloading and pattern matching. Although Java doesn&apos;t
    permit any of these techniques, next-generation JVM languages do, with varying
    implementation details. In this article, Neal Ford investigates how Groovy, Scala, and Clojure realize the intent of the Interpreter design pattern by allowing functional extensions in ways that Java does not.]]></description>

		<title><![CDATA[Java development 2.0: Securing Java application data for cloud computing]]></title>
		
		<description><![CDATA[Data security is a serious concern for organizations considering cloud
    adoption, but in many cases it needn&apos;t be.  In this installment of Java development
    2.0, learn how to use private-key encryption and the Advanced Encryption Standard to
    secure sensitive application data for the cloud. You&apos;ll also get a quick tutorial on encryption strategy, which is important for maximizing the efficiency of conditional searches on distributed cloud datastores.]]></description>

		<title><![CDATA[Passing data objects between CICS Java environments: Part 2: Techniques for passing Java data objects]]></title>
		
		<description><![CDATA[Java is becoming a popular programming language for CICS applications. CICS provides multiple Java environments, each with its own strengths, so passing data objects between the different CICS Java environments is an important topic. This three-part article series gives you the details. Part 2 uses an example Java class to show you how to pass Java data objects between applications running in a CICS-pooled JVM, an Axis2-based JVM, a CICS Dynamic Scripting environment, and a CICS OSGi-based JVM.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[RichFaces, like most other rich/Ajax component frameworks designed for use with JavaServer Faces (JSF), was extensively revamped for compatibility with the significant changes in JSF 2. Joe Sam Shirah examines changed and new RichFaces 4.1 components that provide the same functionality he demonstrated in &quot;An introduction to RichFaces&quot; with version 3.1. He also updates the setup requirements for using RichFaces with JSF.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Java is becoming a popular programming language for CICS applications. CICS provides multiple Java environments, each with its own strengths, so passing data objects between the different CICS Java environments is an important topic. This article series gives you the details. Part 1 describes the CICS Java environments, the advantages of each one, and the different ways to pass data between them. 
Part 2 uses an example Java class to show you how to pass Java data objects between applications running in a CICS-pooled JVM, an Axis2-based JVM, a CICS Dynamic Scripting environment, 
and a CICS OSGi-based JVM. Part 3 shows you how to pass Java data objects from a CICS Transaction Gateway Java client program to a CICS-pooled JVM or CICS OSGi-based JVM.]]></description>
