  &lt;p id="question"&gt;How big of a lawn would you have to have so that when you finished mowing you&amp;#39;d need to start over because the grass has grown?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attribute"&gt;Nick Nelson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.turf.uiuc.edu/extension/ext-mow.html"&gt;Turfgrass Extension and Outreach&lt;/a&gt; program at UIUC,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://admissions.illinois.edu/visit/selfguided/quad.html#morrow"&gt;Morrow cornfields&lt;/a&gt; operated by the university are the most valuable cornfields in the world, and part of one of the world&amp;#39;s longest-running scientific experiments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; every mowing should remove one third of the grass blade&amp;#39;s height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="The UIUC Turfgrass 2013 Battle Plan, I hope." src="/imgs/a/70/lawn_cuthere.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grass grows slower or faster depending on the weather, but we&amp;#39;ll assume an average growth rate of 0.2 inches per day. This figure comes from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.extension.iastate.edu/publications/pm1213.pdf"&gt;Mowing Your Lawn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a document published by by Iowa State&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.yardandgarden.extension.iastate.edu/"&gt;Yard and Garden Extension&lt;/a&gt; program (which, I like to imagine, has a vicious and occasionally bloody rivalry with the UIUC Turfgrass crew).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical pushmower at a fast walking speed can mow a little under a square meter per second. If you mowed without stopping from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, you would cover about 25,000 square meters.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;or 6 acres, or 2.5 hectares, or 7,500 square fathoms, or 8,500 square smoots, or 5,300 Shrouds of Turin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To maintain your lawn at a height of four inches, you would need to mow it every ten days. If you mowed more or less frequently, you could risk damaging the lawn—or, worse, incur the wrath of UIUC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ten hours of mowing per day, you could cover a quarter of a square kilometer before you&amp;#39;d have to circle back to the beginning and start over. If the entire area of Vatican City, indoors and out, were covered in perennial ryegrass,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Perhaps due to an ill-advised UIUC undergraduate project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; you would be able to keep about half of it neatly trimmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="With the help of Pope Emeritus Benedict, they could cover the whole thing!" src="/imgs/a/70/lawn_pope.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could improve on this with a larger, faster mower. An oversized rider mower at 12 miles per hour&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;The maximum listed in the &lt;a href="http://www.cubcadet.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CubCadetFullPageArticleDisplayView?langId=-1&amp;amp;storeId=10051&amp;amp;catalogId=14101&amp;amp;pageView=Cubcadet_Commercial/AcresPerHour.html"&gt;Cub Cadet rider mower acres-per-hour chart&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could mow as much as two square kilometers, which Wolfram|Alpha &lt;a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+km%5E2"&gt;helpfully tells me&lt;/a&gt; is 0.5% to 1% of an adult male cougar&amp;#39;s home range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="A cougar chasing down a deere." src="/imgs/a/70/lawn_cougar.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Bobby Cleveland set a world record for the top speed in a riding lawnmower, hitting 96 mph. This record was set as part of a rivalry with the British lawnmower driver Don Wales.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;&lt;a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20017942-48.html"&gt;Really&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blow to its national pride, the US has lost that record. Sometime in the last few years, the magazine &lt;em&gt;Top Gear&lt;/em&gt; commissioned Honda to build them an even faster lawnmower. A few months ago, this mower—which shoots flames from the exhaust pipe—broke 100 mph on a test track in France.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23342347"&gt;First tests of &amp;#39;130mph&amp;#39; lawnmower&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, BBC News Technology, 17 July 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The builders claim it will eventually reach 130 mph. The mower is still capable of cutting grass (using a custom wire mechanism), but when running at top speed the trimmer is removed for safety reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;em&gt;Top Gear&lt;/em&gt; mower, what&amp;#39;s the maximum area we could cut?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s set safety aside and assume we can leave the mower&amp;#39;s cutting mechanism in place. Let&amp;#39;s also assume that the mower can cut a strip two meters wide while running at top speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under those assumptions, if the mower is run for 24 hours a day, seven days a week ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Since cougars aren&amp;#39;t found in Europe, perhaps &amp;#39;top speed by a rider mower carrying a cougar&amp;#39; is a record that Americans can more reliably dominate." src="/imgs/a/70/lawn_cougar_2.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... it could just about keep one adult male cougar&amp;#39;s home range neatly trimmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

  &lt;a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/69/"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Facebook of the Dead&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id="question"&gt;When, if ever, will Facebook contain more profiles of dead people than of living ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attribute"&gt;Emily Dunham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either the 2060s or the 2130s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="&amp;#39;Put on your headphones!&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Can&amp;#39;t. Ears fell off.&amp;#39;" src="/imgs/a/69/facebook_zombie.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are not a lot of dead people on Facebook. The main reasons for this is that Facebook—and its users—are young. The average Facebook user has gotten older over the last few years, but the site is still used at a much higher rate by the young than by the old.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;There are a zillion surveys confirming this, such as &lt;a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Twitter-Use-Drives-Up-LinkedIn-Stalls-UK/1009796"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; from eMarketer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Past:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the site&amp;#39;s growth rate, and the age breakdown of their users over time,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;You can get user counts for each age group from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/create"&gt;Facebook&amp;#39;s create-an-ad tool&lt;/a&gt;, although you may want to try to account for the fact that Facebook&amp;#39;s age limits cause some people to lie about their ages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; there are probably 10 to 20 million people who created Facebook profiles who have since died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people are, at the moment, spread out pretty evenly across the age spectrum. Young people have a much lower death rate than people in their sixties or seventies, but they make up a substantial share of the dead on Facebook simply because there have been so many of them using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 290,000 US Facebook users will die (or have died) in 2013. The worldwide total for 2013 is likely several million.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Note: In some of these projections, I used US age/usage data extrapolated to the Facebook userbase as a whole, because it&amp;#39;s easier to find US census and actuarial numbers than to assemble the country-by-country for the whole Facebook-using world. The US isn&amp;#39;t a perfect model of the world, but the basic dynamics—young people&amp;#39;s Facebook adoption determines the site&amp;#39;s success or failure while population growth continues for a while and then levels off—will probably hold approximately true. If we assume a rapid Facebook saturation in the developing world, which currently has a faster-growing and younger population, it shifts many of the landmarks by a handful of years, but doesn&amp;#39;t change the overall picture as much as you might expect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In just seven years, this death rate will double, and in seven more years it will double again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Facebook closes registration tomorrow, the number of deaths per year will continue to grow for many decades, as the generation who was in college between 2000 and 2020 grows old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="An elderly Cory Doctorow cosplaying by wearing what the future thinks he wore in the past." src="/imgs/a/69/facebook_cory.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deciding factor in when the dead will outnumber the living is whether Facebook adds new living users—ideally, young ones—fast enough to outrun this tide of death for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook 2100:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the question of Facebook&amp;#39;s future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have enough experience with social networks to say with any kind of certainty how long Facebook will last. Most websites have flared up and then gradually declined in popularity, so it&amp;#39;s reasonable to assume Facebook will follow that pattern.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;I&amp;#39;m assuming, in these cases, that no data is ever deleted. So far, that&amp;#39;s been a reasonable assumption; if you&amp;#39;ve made a Facebook profile, that data probably still exists, and most people who stop using a service don&amp;#39;t bother to delete their profile. If that behavior changes, or if Facebook performs a mass purging of their archives, the balance could change rapidly and unpredictably.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that scenario, where Facebook starts losing market share later this decade and never recovers, Facebook&amp;#39;s crossover date—the date when the dead outnumber the living—will come sometime around 2065.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="" src="/imgs/a/69/facebook_early.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe it won&amp;#39;t. Maybe it will take on a role like the TCP protocol, where it becomes a piece of infrastructure on which other things are built, and has the inertia of consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Facebook is with us for generations, then the crossover date could be as late as the mid-2100s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="" src="/imgs/a/69/facebook_late.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems unlikely. Nothing lasts forever, and rapid change has been the norm for anything built on computer technology. The ground is littered with the bones of websites and technologies that seemed like permanent institutions ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible the reality could be somewhere in between.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Of course, if there&amp;#39;s a sudden rapid increase in the death rate of Facebook users—possibly one that includes humans in general—the crossover could happen tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We&amp;#39;ll just have to wait and find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fate of our accounts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook can afford to keep all our pages and data indefinitely. Living users will always generate more data than dead ones, and the accounts for active users are the ones that will need to be easily accessible. Even if accounts for dead (or inactive) people make up a majority of their users, it will probably never add up to a large part of their overall infrastructure budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important will be our decisions. What do we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; for those pages? Unless we demand that Facebook deletes them, they will presumably, by default, keep copies of everything forever. Even if they don&amp;#39;t, other data-vacuuming organizations will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, next-of-kin &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/305593649477238"&gt;can convert a dead person&amp;#39;s Facebook profile&lt;/a&gt; into a memorial page. But there are a lot of questions surrounding passwords and access to private data that we haven&amp;#39;t yet developed social norms for. Should accounts remain accessible? What should be made private? Should next-of-kin have the right to access email? Should memorial pages have comments? How do we handle trolling and vandalism? Should people be allowed to interact with dead user accounts? What lists of friends should they show up on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are issues that we&amp;#39;re currently in the process of sorting out by trial and error. Death has always been a big, difficult, and emotionally charged subject, and every society finds different ways to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic pieces that make up a human life don&amp;#39;t change. We&amp;#39;ve always eaten, learned, grown, fallen in love, fought, and died. In every place, culture, and technological landscape, we develop a different set of behaviors around these same activites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like every group that came before us, we&amp;#39;re learning how to play those same games on our particular playing field. We&amp;#39;re developing, through sometimes messy trial and error, a new set of social norms for dating, arguing, learning, and growing on the internet. Sooner or later, we&amp;#39;ll figure out how to mourn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="★★☆☆☆" src="/imgs/a/69/facebook_grave.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Halloween!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

  &lt;a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/68/"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Little Planet&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id="question"&gt;If an asteroid was very small but supermassive, could you really live on it like the Little Prince?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attribute"&gt;Samantha Harper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we looked at at life on a &lt;a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/67/"&gt;giant world&lt;/a&gt;. This week, let&amp;#39;s look at a small one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="&amp;#39;Did you eat my rose?&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Maybe.&amp;#39;" src="/imgs/a/68/asteroid_asteroid.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Prince&lt;/em&gt;, by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, is a story about a traveler from a distant asteroid. It&amp;#39;s simple and sad and poignant and memorable.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;For another take on the Petit Prince, scroll down to the last section of &lt;a href="http://the-toast.net/2013/08/02/texts-from-peter-pan-et-al/"&gt;this wonderful piece&lt;/a&gt; by Mallory Ortberg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It&amp;#39;s ostensibly a children&amp;#39;s book, but it&amp;#39;s hard to pin down who the intended audience is. In any case, it certainly &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; found an audience; it&amp;#39;s among the best-selling books in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Personally, I always thought it looked like a snake that had swallowed a hat." src="/imgs/a/68/asteroid_snake.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was written in 1942. That&amp;#39;s an interesting time to write about asteroids, because in 1942 we didn&amp;#39;t actually know what asteroids &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; like. Even in our best telescopes, the largest asteroids were only visible as points of light. In fact, that&amp;#39;s where their name comes from—the word &lt;em&gt;asteroid&lt;/em&gt; means &amp;quot;star-like.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got our first confirmation of what asteroids looked like in 1971, when Mariner 9 visited Mars and snapped pictures of Phobos and Deimos.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;&lt;a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/m09_mtvs4109_09.html"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; a picture of Phobos looking like the archetypical asteroid. The archived images from the mission are at the &lt;a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?ds=PSPG-00235"&gt;NASA Space Science Data Center&lt;/a&gt;, but strangely, the NSSDC refers readers to someone&amp;#39;s personal &lt;a href="http://petermasek.tripod.com/mariner9.html"&gt;Tripod page&lt;/a&gt; to browse the actual images.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These moons, believed to be captured asteroids,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Ironically, while Phobos and Deimos &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like asteroids, new research suggests they&amp;#39;re not. See Craddock, Robert A.. &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103510004100"&gt;Are Phobos And Deimos The Result Of A Giant Impact?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. &lt;em&gt;Icarus&lt;/em&gt; (2010)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; solidified the modern image of asteroids as cratered potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="A potato." src="/imgs/a/68/asteroid_potato.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the 1970s, it was common for science fiction to assume small asteroids would be round, like planets.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Not always; plenty of people had a good idea of what they would look like. And there were &lt;a href="http://pencilink.blogspot.com/2010/08/uncle-scrooge-29-carl-barks-art-cover.html"&gt;stranger ideas&lt;/a&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Prince&lt;/em&gt; took this a step further, imagining an asteroid as a tiny planet with gravity, air, and a rose. There&amp;#39;s no point in trying to critique the science here, because (1) it&amp;#39;s not a story about asteroids, and (2) it opens with a parable about how foolish adults are for looking at everything too literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than trying to take things away from the story, let&amp;#39;s see what strange new pieces science can add. If there really were a superdense asteroid with enough surface gravity to walk around on, it would have some pretty surprising properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the asteroid has a radius of 1.75 meters, then in order to have Earth-like gravity at the surface, it would need to have a mass of about 500 million tons. This is roughly equal to the combined mass of every human on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stood on the surface, you&amp;#39;d experience tidal forces. Your feet would feel heavier than your head, which you&amp;#39;d feel as a gentle stretching sensation. It would feel like you were stretched out on a curved rubber ball, or were lying on a merry-go-round with your head near the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="My back hasn&amp;#39;t felt this good in years." src="/imgs/a/68/asteroid_tides.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escape velocity at the surface would be about 5 meters per second. That&amp;#39;s slower than a sprint, but still pretty fast. As a rule of thumb, if you can&amp;#39;t dunk a basketball, you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to escape by jumping straight up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="I believe I can flyyyy" src="/imgs/a/68/asteroid_basketball.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the weird thing about escape velocity is that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter which direction you&amp;#39;re going.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;... which is why it should really be called &amp;quot;escape speed&amp;quot;—the fact that it has no direction (which is the distinction between &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;velocity&amp;quot;) is actually very significant here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you go faster than the escape speed, as long as you don&amp;#39;t actually go &lt;em&gt;toward&lt;/em&gt; the planet, you&amp;#39;ll escape. That means you might be able to leave our asteroid by running horizontally and jumping off the end of a ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee" src="/imgs/a/68/asteroid_ramp.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t go fast enough to escape the planet, you&amp;#39;d go into orbit around it. Your orbital speed would be roughly 3 meters per second, which is a typical jogging speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Those ants down below look like people." src="/imgs/a/68/asteroid_orbit.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this would be a &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidal forces would act on you in several ways. If you reach your arm down toward the planet, it would be pulled much harder than the rest of you. And if you reach down with one arm, the rest of you gets pushed upward, which means other parts of your body feel even &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; gravity. Effectively, every part of your body would be trying to go in a different orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large orbiting object under these kinds of tidal forces—say, a moon—will generally break apart into rings. This wouldn&amp;#39;t happen to you. However, your orbit would become chaotic and unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of orbits were investigated in an interesting paper by Radu D. Rugescu and Daniele Mortari.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Rugescu, Radu D., Mortari, Daniele, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.academia.edu/3453325/Ultra_Long_Orbital_Tethers_Behave_Highly_Non-Keplerian_and_Unstable"&gt;Ultra Long Orbital Tethers Behave Highly Non-Keplerian and Unstable&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;WSEAS Transactions on Mathematics&lt;/em&gt;, Vol. 7, No. 3, March 2008, pp. 87-94.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Their simulations showed that large, elongated objects follow strange patterns around their central bodies. Even their centers of mass don&amp;#39;t move in the traditional ellipses; some adopt pentagonal orbits, while others spin chaotically and crash into the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of analysis could actually have practical applications. There have been various proposals over the years to use long, whirling tethers to move cargo in and out of gravity wells—a sort of free-floating &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator"&gt;space elevator&lt;/a&gt;. Such tethers could transport cargo to and from the surface of the Moon, or to pick up spacecraft from the edge of the Earth&amp;#39;s atmosphere. The inherent instability of many tether orbits poses an interesting challenge for this kind of project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the residents of our superdense asteroid, they&amp;#39;d have to be careful; if they ran too fast, they&amp;#39;d be in serious danger of going into a tumble and losing their lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, vertical jumps would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/67/"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Expanding Earth&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id="question"&gt;How long would it take for people to notice their weight gain if the mean radius of the world expanded by 1cm every second? (Assuming the average composition of rock were maintained.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attribute"&gt;Dennis O&amp;#39;Donnell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth is not, currently, expanding.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Yes, I have a citation for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br &gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;In conclusion, no statistically significant present expansion rate is detected by our study within the current measurement uncertainty of 0.2 mm yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wu, X., X. Collilieux, Z. Altamimi, B. L. A. Vermeersen, R. S. Gross, and I. Fukumori (2011), &lt;a href="http://repository.tudelft.nl/view/ir/uuid%3A72ed93c0-d13e-427c-8c5f-f013b737750e/"&gt;Accuracy of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame origin and Earth expansion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Geophys. Res. Lett.&lt;/em&gt;, 38, L13304, &lt;a href="doi:10.1029/2011GL047450"&gt;doi:10.1029/2011GL047450&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have long suggested that it might be. Before the continential drift hypothesis was confirmed in the 1960s,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;The smoking gun that confirmed the plate tectonics hypothesis was the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading"&gt;seafloor spreading&lt;/a&gt;. The way seafloor spreading and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal"&gt;magnetic pole reversal&lt;/a&gt; neatly confirmed each other is one of my favorite examples of scientific discovery at work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; people had noticed that the continents fit together. Various ideas were put forward to explain this, including the idea that the ocean basins were rifts that opened in the surface of a previously-smooth Earth as it expanded. This theory was never very widespread,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;It turns out it&amp;#39;s kind of dumb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; although it still periodically makes the rounds on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the problem of rifts in the ground, let&amp;#39;s imagine all the matter in the Earth, from the crust to the core, starts expanding uniformly. To avoid another &lt;a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/53/"&gt;Drain the Oceans&lt;/a&gt; scenario, we&amp;#39;ll assume the ocean expands, too.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;As it turns out, the ocean &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; expanding, since it&amp;#39;s getting warmer. This is (currently) the main way global warming is raising the sea level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; All human structures will stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t = 1 second:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Oh, ok." src="/imgs/a/67/expanding_jolt.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Earth started expanding, you&amp;#39;d feel a slight jolt, and might even lose your balance for a moment. This would be very brief. Since you&amp;#39;re moving steadily upward at 1 cm/s, you woudn&amp;#39;t feel any kind of ongoing acceleration. For the rest of the day, you wouldn&amp;#39;t notice much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t = 1 day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first day, the Earth would have expanded by 864 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Let&amp;#39;s go ride bikes!" src="/imgs/a/67/expanding_day.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gravity would take a long time to increase. If you weighed 70 kilograms when the expansion started, you&amp;#39;d weigh 70.01 at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about our roads and bridges? Eventually, they would have to break up, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not as quickly as you might think. Here&amp;#39;s a puzzle I once heard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine you tied a rope tightly around the Earth, so it was hugging the surface all the way around.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="This diagram taken from some ambitious Ikea assembly instructions." src="/imgs/a/67/expanding_rope.png"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now imagine you wanted to raise the rope one meter off the ground.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="This chair doesn&amp;#39;t look right." src="/imgs/a/67/expanding_lift.png"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;How much extra length will you need to add to the rope?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it may seem like you&amp;#39;d need miles of rope, the answer is 6.28 meters. Circumference is proportional to radius, so if you increase radius by 1 unit, you increase circumference by 2&amp;pi; units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stretching a 40,000-kilometer line an extra 6.28 meters is pretty negligible. Even after a day, the extra 5.4 kilometers would be handled easily by virtually all structures. Concrete expands and contracts by more than that every day.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Lawrence Grybosky, &lt;a href="http://www.engr.psu.edu/ce/courses/ce584/concrete/library/cracking/thermalexpansioncontraction/thermalexpcontr.htm"&gt;Thermal Expansion and Contraction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial jolt, one of the first effects you&amp;#39;d notice would be that your GPS would stop working. The satellites would stay in roughly the same orbits, but the delicate timing that the GPS system is based on would be completely ruined within hours. GPS timing is incredibly precise; of all the problems in engineering, it&amp;#39;s one of the only ones in which engineers have been forced to include both special &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; general relativity in their calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most other clocks would keep working fine. However, if you have a very precise pendulum clock, you might notice something odd—by the end of the day, it would be three seconds ahead of where it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t = 1 month:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a month, the Earth would have expanded by 26 kilometers—an increase of 0.4%—and its mass would have increased by 1.2%. Surface gravity would only have gone up by 0.4%, rather than 1.2%, since surface gravity is proportional to radius.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Mass is proportional to radius cubed, and gravity is proportional to mass times inverse square of radius, so radius&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / radius&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = radius.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might notice the difference in weight on a scale, but it&amp;#39;s not a big deal. Gravity varies by this much between different cities already. This is a good thing to keep in mind if you buy a digital scale. If your scale has a precision of more than two decimal places, you need to calibrate it with a test weight—the force of gravity at the scale factory isn&amp;#39;t necessarily the same as the force of gravity at your house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you might not notice the increased gravity just yet, you&amp;#39;d notice the expansion. After a month, you&amp;#39;d see a lot of cracks opening up in long concrete structures and the failure of elevated roads and old bridges. Most buildings would probably be ok, although those anchored firmly into bedrock might start to behave unpredictably.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Just what you want in a skyscraper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, astronauts on the ISS would start getting worried. Not only would the ground (and atmosphere) be rising toward them, but the increased gravity would also cause their orbit to slowly shrink. They&amp;#39;d need to evacuate quickly; they&amp;#39;d have at most a few months before the station reentered the atmosphere and deorbited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t = 1 year:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year, gravity would be 5% stronger. You&amp;#39;d probably notice the weight gain, and you&amp;#39;d definitely notice the failure of roads, bridges, power lines, satellites, and undersea cables. Your pendulum clock would now be ahead by five days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the atmosphere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the atmosphere isn&amp;#39;t growing like the land and water are, air pressure would start dropping. This is due to a combination of factors. As gravity increases, then air gets heavier. But since that air is spread out over a larger area, the overall effect would be &lt;em&gt;decreasing&lt;/em&gt; air pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the atmosphere is also expanding, surface air pressure would rise. After years had passed, the top of Mt. Everest would no longer be in the &amp;quot;death zone&amp;quot;.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[8]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;See &lt;a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/64/"&gt;What-If #64&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, since you&amp;#39;d be heavier—and the mountain would be taller—climbing would be more work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t = 5 years:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After five years, gravity would be 25% stronger. If you weighed 70 kg when the expansion started, you&amp;#39;d weigh 88 kg now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our infrastructure would have collapsed. The cause of the collapse would be the expanding ground below them, not the increased gravity. Surprisingly, most skyscrapers would hold up fine under much higher gravity.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[9]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Although I wouldn&amp;#39;t trust the elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For most of them, the limiting factor isn&amp;#39;t weight, but wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t = 10 years:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 10 years, gravity would be 50% stronger. In the scenario where the atmosphere isn&amp;#39;t expanding, the air would become thin enough to be difficult to breathe even at sea level. In the other scenario, we&amp;#39;d be ok for a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t = 40 years:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 40 years, Earth&amp;#39;s surface gravity would have tripled.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[10]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Over decades, the force of gravity would grow slightly faster than you&amp;#39;d expect, since the material in the Earth would compress under its own weight. The pressure inside planets is &lt;a href="http://cseligman.com/text/planets/internalpressure.htm"&gt;roughly proportional to the square of their surface area&lt;/a&gt;, so the Earth&amp;#39;s core would be squeezed tightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; At this point, even the strongest humans would only be able to walk with great difficulty. Breathing would be difficult. Trees would collapse. Crops wouldn&amp;#39;t stand up under their own weight. Virtually every mountainside would see massive landslides as material sought out a shallower &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_repose"&gt;angle of repose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geologic activity would also accelerate. Most of the Earth&amp;#39;s heat is provided by radioactive decay of minerals in the crust and mantle,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[12]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Although some radioactive elements, like uranium, are heavy, they get squeezed out of the lower layers because their atoms don&amp;#39;t mesh well with the rock lattices at those depths. For more, see &lt;a href="http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/~guy/sio103/chap3.pdf"&gt;this chapter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Uranium-Resources/The-Cosmic-Origins-of-Uranium/#.UlxuGmRDJf4"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and more Earth means more heat. Since the volume expands faster than the surface area, the overall heat flowing out per square meter will increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not actually enough to substantially warm the planet—Earth&amp;#39;s surface temperature is dominated by the atmosphere and the Sun—but it would lead to more volcanoes, more earthquakes, and faster tectonic movement. This would be similar to the situation on Earth billions of years ago, when we had more radioactive material and thus a hotter mantle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More active plate tectonics might be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for life. Plate tectonics play a key role in stabilizing the Earth&amp;#39;s climate, and planets smaller than Earth (like Mars) don&amp;#39;t have enough internal heat to sustain long-term geologic activity. A larger planet would allow for more geologic activity, which is why some scientists think that exoplanets slightly larger than Earth (&amp;quot;super-Earths&amp;quot;) could be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; friendly to life than Earth-sized ones.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[11]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Sasselov, Dimitar D.. &lt;em&gt;The life of super-Earths: how the hunt for alien worlds and artificial cells will revolutionize life on our planet&lt;/em&gt;. New York: Basic Books, 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t = 100 years:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 100 years, we&amp;#39;d be experiencing over six gees of gravity. Not only would we be unable to move around to find food, but our hearts would be unable to pump blood to our brains. Only small insects (and sea animals) would be physically able to move around. Perhaps humans could survive in specially-built controlled-pressure domes, moving around by keeping most of our bodies submerged in water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Early scientists believed, based on the fossil record, that humans must be aquatic; it would be the only way they could have supported their weight against gravity." src="/imgs/a/67/expanding_water.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathing in this situation would be difficult. It&amp;#39;s hard to suck in air against the weight of the water, which is why snorkels can only work when your lungs are near the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of low-pressure domes, the air would become unbreathable for a different reason. At somewhere around 6 atmospheres, even ordinary air becomes toxic.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[13]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;R.M. Franz and P.C. Schutte, &lt;a href="http://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v105n06p387.pdf"&gt;Barometric hazards within the context of deep-level mining&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Journal of The South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even if we&amp;#39;d managed to survive all the other problems, by 100 years, we&amp;#39;d be dead from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity"&gt;oxygen toxicity&lt;/a&gt;. Toxicity aside, breathing dense air is difficult simply because it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;heavy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black hole?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When would the Earth eventually become a black hole?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to answer that, because the premise of the question is that the radius is steadily expanding while the density stays the same—whereas a black hole, the density increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of really huge rocky planets aren&amp;#39;t often analyzed, since there&amp;#39;s no obvious way that they could form; anything that large will have enough gravity to gather hydrogen and helium during planet formation and become a gas giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, our growing Earth would reach the point where adding more mass causes it to contract, rather than expand. After this point, it would collapse into something like a sputtering white dwarf or neutron star, and then—if its mass kept increasing—eventually become a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before it gets that far ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t = 300 years:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a shame humans wouldn&amp;#39;t live this long, because at this point, something really neat would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Earth grows, the Moon would, like all our satellites, gradually spiral inward.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[14]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Plummer, H. C., &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1906MNRAS..66...83P"&gt;Note on the motion about an attracting centre of slowly increasing mass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&lt;/em&gt;, Vol. 66, p.83&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; After several centuries, it would be close enough to the swollen Earth that the tidal forces between Earth and the Moon would be stronger than the gravitational forces holding the Moon together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Moon passed this boundary—called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit"&gt;Roche limit&lt;/a&gt;—it would gradually break apart ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="If you liked it then you should have moved a mass inside its Roche limit." src="/imgs/a/67/expanding_rings.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and Earth would, for a short time, have rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

  &lt;a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/66/"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;500 MPH&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id="question"&gt;If winds reached 500 mph, would it pick up a human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attribute"&gt;Grey Flynn, age 7, Stoneham, MA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Grey Flynn, age 7, rapidly exiting Stoneham, MA." src="/imgs/a/66/wind_pickup.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things don&amp;#39;t work like they do in the movies. Getting shot doesn&amp;#39;t really make someone fly backward. The vacuum of space doesn&amp;#39;t make your skin explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But high wind can &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; pick up a person. In fact, if you were standing in the parking lot, the wind wouldn&amp;#39;t just pick you up—it would also peel the pavement from the ground!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="The strongest tornadoes often peel up pavement." src="/imgs/a/66/wind_pavement.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;#39;t be strong enough to peel your skin off. Humans can survive blasts of 500 mph wind, which is important because pilots sometimes need to eject from airplanes at those speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1940s, the US government put pilots in wind tunnels to learn how they reacted to high winds. Have you ever been curious what happens to a person&amp;#39;s face in 457 mph winds? Well, you can watch a video of one of those wind tunnel tests &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU4SDDNXuUA"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (That test was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center, where I worked before I started drawing internet comics for a living.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t look very comfortable—I didn&amp;#39;t know cheeks could flap like that—but the pilot appears to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, he&amp;#39;s strapped into that chair. He wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to stand up in those winds! If he tried, he would go flying backward down the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High wind is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; powerful. In a paper in the journal &lt;em&gt;Weather&lt;/em&gt;, J. F. R. McIlveen showed how to calculate the force of wind on the human body.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;McIlveen, J. F. R.. &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1256/wea.29.02/pdf"&gt;The Everyday Effects Of Wind Drag On People.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; Weather 57, no. 11 (2002): 410-413.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The calculations on page 2 show how far you&amp;#39;d have to lean to stay upright in wind of various speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="I carry this chart around so if I get hit by a tornado, I&amp;#39;ll know how far to lean." src="/imgs/a/66/wind_lean.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When wind speed rises above about 120 mph, it&amp;#39;s no longer possible to stay upright no matter how far you lean; you&amp;#39;ll start to slide backward across the ground,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;When Hurricane Isabel hit Virginia in 2003, I had the bright idea of standing on a skateboard with a poncho held up like a sail, so the wind would blow me down the street. But the moment I got the sail up, the wind fell quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, I learned that people &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1327705/Kite-surfer-28-dies-gale-drags-100mph-beach-drops-50ft.html"&gt;die from doing that&lt;/a&gt;. Oops.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; then quickly go head over heels and start to tumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily be thrown very high. If the wind were perfectly level, you&amp;#39;d tumble along the surface, bouncing against the ground. However, if there were any updrafts, you could easily be lifted up and carried away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that 500 mph winds are rare. The strongest hurricanes have wind speeds around 200 mph with gusts up to 250.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Courtney, J.; Buchan, S.; Cerveny, R.S.; Bessemoulin, P.; Peterson, T.C.; Rubiera Torres, J.M.; Beven, J.; King, J.; Trerwin, B.; Rancourt, K.. 2012 &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/amoj/docs/2012/courtney_hres.pdf"&gt;Documentation and verification of the world extreme wind gust record: 113.3 m s–1 on Barrow Island, Australia, during passage of tropical cyclone Olivia.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; Australian Meterological and Oceanographic Journal, 62 (1). 1-9.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Tornadoes can reach 300 mph.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;It&amp;#39;s difficult to get accurate measurements of surface winds since those tornadoes &lt;a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#History"&gt;destroy most measuring equipment&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 300 is a far cry from 500; the force from a 500 mph wind is several times stronger than the force from a 300 mph wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways you could experience wind speeds faster than 500 mph. One is to stand on top of a volcano when it erupts. When Mount St. Helens exploded in 1980, the column of ash was blasted outward at 700 mph, which is close to the speed of sound.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Kieffer, S. W., 1981, Fluid dynamics of the May 18 blast at Mount St. Helens, in Lipman, P.W., and Mullineux, D.R., eds., The 1980 Eruptions of Mount St. Helens, Washington: U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1250, p. 379-400.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to experience 500 mph winds is to trigger a hypercane.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;&lt;a href="http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/holem/holem.html"&gt;Limits on Hurricane Intensity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A hypercane is an exotic type of hurricane with 500 mph winds spinning in a very tight vortex just a few miles across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypercanes can&amp;#39;t exist on Earth right now. To form, they require ocean temperatures of about 50°C. No matter how much we warm the planet, we&amp;#39;re not going to get the temperature &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; high any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s one way these storms might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an asteroid or comet—coincidentally, one about the size of the recently-named &lt;a href="http://blog.xkcd.com/2013/09/30/asteroid-4942-munroe/"&gt;4942 Munroe&lt;/a&gt;—hit Mexico 65 million years ago, it punched a hole in the crust and left behind a sea of lava.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Christeson, Gail L., Gareth S. Collins, Joanna V. Morgan, Sean P.S. Gulick, Penny J. Barton, and Michael R. Warner. &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/4214/1/icpub.pdf"&gt;Mantle Deformation Beneath The Chicxulub Impact Crater&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; Earth and Planetary Science Letters 284, no. 1-2 (2009): 249-257.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When water flowed back in to fill the hole, it would have been heated by contact with the molten rock. This might have created the conditions for hypercanes to form, and one paper suggests that these storms could have lifted a large amount of dust and debris into the upper atmosphere—thus contributing to a global winter and extinction of the dinosaurs.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[8]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Emanuel, Kerry A., Kevin Speer, Richard Rotunno, Ramesh Srivastava, and Mario Molina. &amp;quot;&lt;a href="ftp://texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/hypercane95.pdf"&gt;Hypercanes: A Possible Link In Global Extinction Scenarios&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; Journal of Geophysical Research 100, no. D7 (1995): 13755-13765.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the answer to Grey&amp;#39;s question is yes—500 mph winds would send you flying through the air. But don&amp;#39;t worry about that. Instead, worry about is the thing that &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt; the 500 mph winds. Odds are, &lt;em&gt;that&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; what&amp;#39;s going to kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
