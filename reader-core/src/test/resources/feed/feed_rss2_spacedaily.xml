Over the years, the spacefaring nations of Earth have sent dozens of probes and rovers to explore Mars. Today there are three active satellites circling the red planet while two rovers, Opportunity and Curiosity, wheel across the red sands below. Mars is dry, barren, and apparently lifeless. Soon, those assets could find themselves exploring a very different kind of world.

The American Nobel Prize Laureate for Physics Richard Feynman once described turbulence as "the most important unsolved problem of classical physics", because a description of the phenomenon from first principles does not exist. This is still regarded as one of the six most important problems in mathematics today.

Ozone stinks. People who breathe it gag as their lungs burn. The EPA classifies ground-level ozone as air pollution. Yet without it, life on Earth would be impossible. A fragile layer of ozone 25 km above Earth's surface is all that stands between us and some of the harshest UV rays from the sun. The ozone molecule O3 blocks radiation which would otherwise burn skin and cause cancer.

A laboratory experiment at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., simulating the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan suggests complex organic chemistry that could eventually lead to the building blocks of life extends lower in the atmosphere than previously thought. The results now point out another region on the moon that could brew up prebiotic materials. The paper was published in ]]></description>

Researchers at The University of Auckland have proposed a new method for finding Earth-like planets, and they anticipate that the number will be in the order of 100 billion. 

The strategy uses a technique called gravitational microlensing, currently used by a Japan-New Zealand collaboration called MOA (Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics) at New Zealand's Mt. John Observatory. Their w]]></description>

These seven HiRISE images were acquired between August 12, 2012 and January 13, 2013, and show distinct changes in the parachute (at bottom, attached to the backshell at top). In the first four images there are only subtle changes, perhaps explained by differences in viewing and illumination geometry. 

Sometime between September 8, 2012 and November 30, 2012, there was a major change in whi]]></description>

The rare Green Pea galaxies discovered by the general public in 2007 could help confirm astronomers' understanding of reionization, a pivotal stage in the evolution of the early universe, say University of Michigan researchers. 

Reionization occurred a few hundred million years after the Big Bang as the first stars were turning on and forming the first galaxies. During this period, the spac]]></description>

Uncloaking the secrets of dark matter in the universe is a cosmological conundrum puzzling some of the brightest astrophysicists. 

An upcoming conference, sponsored by the American Astronomical Societyand organized by Rochester Institute of Technology professor Sukanya Chakrabarti, will probe the mass that does not absorb or emit light, and which is never seen, only inferred by its gravitat]]></description>

As the universe expands, it is continually subjected to energy shifts, or "quantum fluctuations," that send out little pulses of "sound" into the fabric of spacetime. In fact, the universe is thought to have sprung from just such an energy shift. 

A recent paper in the journal Physical Review Letters reports a new mathematical tool that should allow one to use these sounds to help reveal th]]></description>

Until the launch of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in 2011, scientists had compiled a mere anthill of information about the kinds of charged particles, or cosmic rays, that shoot around the universe. Two short years later, they have amassed an Everest-sized mountain of such information.

 Europe launched its first space weather coordination centre Wednesday to raise the alarm for possible satellite-sizzling solar storms that also threaten astronauts in orbit, plane passengers and electricity grids on Earth.

 A $105 million upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland could double its power and let scientists probe mysterious "dark matter," researchers say. 
 The improvements to the LHC particle accelerator, which last year enabled scientists to discover the Higgs Boson, will allow it to smash protons together at twice its current energy, they said. 
 That could start the hunt for ]]></description>

It's official. Wang Yaping, China's second female astronaut, will fly in space aboard the Shenzhou 10 spacecraft later this year. Chinese state media have confirmed her place on the mission in absolute terms. This is no longer rumour or speculation, but it's hardly a surprise. 

Space analysts (including this writer) have treated this as a near-certainty for a long time. Their speculation wa]]></description>
