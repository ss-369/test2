<description><![CDATA[<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     800x600   </xml><![endif]-->As you know, whenever the earbuds for your iPod or phone are not directly observed, they come alive, like thin, angry snakes. Their single-minded focus is to tie themselves into annoying tangles of knots. My hypothesis is that earbuds hate humans because we are always sticking their tiny heads into our waxy ear holes. If a giant did that to you, you&#39;d probably wait until he was napping and tie his shoelaces together. So I think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening with the earbuds. It&#39;s a revenge thing.<br /><br />Every time I get to the gym, I remove my iPod from my gym bag and discover that my unobserved earbuds have knit themselves into a dense birds&#39; nest. I spend the first ten minutes of my exercise time sorting them out and muttering under my breath that there must be a better way.<br /><br /><img src="/dyn/tiny/File/photo.JPG" alt="" width="397" height="297" /><br /><br />So I decided to invent that better way. I didn&#39;t want to carefully wrap the earbuds up and place them in some sort of protective case. That would be a bother. I wanted to toss the mess in my bag as always, but without the birds&#39; nest problem.<br /><br />My idea was that if I could easily snap the earbuds to the back of the iPod case before tossing the whole mess in my gym bag that would be enough to prevent tangling. I made a prototype of my design using a rubber band. I used the rubber band to secure the ear-ends of the earbuds to the back of the case, and kept the plug connected to the iPod. With both ends of the earbuds secured to the iPod, the dangling cords resisted tangling. I just took it out of my bag, shook twice, and the cords relaxed into a loopy, untangled state. Success!<br /><br />Now I needed a more elegant solution than a rubber band. So I bought some Velcro self-stick material and put one strip on the back of the iPod. A second strip would secure the earbud cords to the first. The Velcro didn&#39;t add enough bulkiness to the iPod for me to notice when it was in my pocket.<br /><br /><img src="/dyn/tiny/File/photo%20(1).JPG" alt="" width="297" height="320" /><br /><br /><img src="/dyn/tiny/File/photo%20(2).JPG" alt="" width="302" height="160" /><br /><br />Success! In field trials, my design worked every time. It was simple to attach the earbuds between the Velcro strips and the cords never tangled in my bag. I was quite proud of my invention.<br /><br />As you know, pride is that wonderful feeling you experience between the time you have a great idea and the time you show it to someone else. I demonstrated my brilliant invention to my teenaged step kids as they watched quietly, in awe I presumed. I used an actual gym bag to demonstrate how the cords would tangle when my concept was not used. Then I wowed them with my invention. I even added a flourish when removing the iPod and cords from the bag. I gave the iPod a casual shake and the cords dropped into a loose, untangled position. I waited for the slow-clap that would become a standing ovation. It was my finest moment as a step dad. Finally, after years of trying, I would earn the respect I craved.<br /><br /><img src="/dyn/tiny/File/photo%20(3).JPG" alt="" width="376" height="394" /><br /><br />My step daughter, who was not in awe of my demonstration, took the earbuds out of my hands and said, &quot;Or you could do this.&quot; She directed me to the little rubber connector on the earbuds themselves that allow you to snap one earpiece to the other. After several trial runs I determined that this too keeps the earbuds from tangling in the bag.<br /><br />So it turns out - and I did not see this coming - that Apple has some engineers who think of stuff too. Nicely played, Apple engineers. <br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Super-Big Problems]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/superbig_problems/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[I&#39;m starting to wonder if the era of super-big problems is over. Wars are trending smaller. Economic meltdowns aren&#39;t quite so deep or lasting. Israel has become so skilled at managing its local threats that a peace treaty would feel like a step backwards. The Gates Foundation is chipping away at malaria. The technology to create and deliver food where it&#39;s needed is better than ever. New energy sources are popping up daily.<br /><br />Generally speaking, the world&#39;s biggest problems have shifted from the right-now type to the pending doom type. Climate change might end us all someday. A meteor might head our way. The global economy might disintegrate because of (insert reason). Iran might build a nuke and use it. Immigration problems might evolve from a nuisance to a huge problem. Pipelines might burst and pollute stuff. Demographics might make us a world full of senile oldsters. And so on.<br /><br />There&#39;s a lot of scary stuff in the &quot;might&quot; category. Luckily, the Adams Theory of Slow-Moving Disasters predicts that any problem the world sees coming gets solved. We humans are surprisingly competent when we focus.<br /><br />The great thing about the connected world is that we can see problems developing early enough to head them off. We can monitor climate change over time. We can detect terror plots before they are executed. We can identify financial bubbles early. We can alter lifestyle to ward off predictable future health problems.<br /><br />A huge advantage of the connected world is that we can study what one government does to address a given problem and then steal those best practices. We could be a lot better at doing that, but the trend seems clear enough.<br /><br />  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now have the means to predict most problems well in advance.<br /><br />  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can borrow best practices from anywhere in the world.<br /><br />  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modern technology provides immense problem-solving tools.<br /><br />Now that civilization has the ability to identify problems early, and the ability to research and borrow best practices to solve those problems, the weak link is government. Our current forms of government - at least the democracies - are poorly designed for data-driven decisions. Dogma, superstition, money, and reelection concerns will always trump data.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a realistic hope of reengineering the basic forms of our elected governments anytime soon. Perhaps we need an independent group of scientists and engineers to identify trending national problems, rank them for importance, and identify best practices from other places. The entrenched political parties will of course ignore data and best practices as they always have. But perhaps the existence of well-publicized best practices will encourage future candidates to run on platforms of data over dogma.<br /><br />I would feel most comfortable if the scientists and engineers in this independent group were atheists who don&#39;t vote and aren&#39;t strongly aligned with any political party - sort of like having eunuchs guard the harem. <br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Chromecast Review]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/chromecast_review/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     800x600   </xml><![endif]-->I&#39;m an early adapter of Google&#39;s new $35 <a href=" http://www.businessinsider.com/google-chromecast-review-2013-8">Chromecast </a>product.<br /><br />I ordered it as soon as I read about it, but not because I wanted the product. I wanted to test my powers of pattern recognition. I do that sometimes. If you live long enough, you can predict which sorts of things won&#39;t work even before you try them. In this case, it seemed unlikely to me that I could scroll through content on my phone and tell the Internet to send it seamlessly to my Chromecast dongle so it could display on my TV. Too many hand-offs and synchronization problems, I thought. It just feels like the sort of thing that looks good on paper but never works when you get it home.<br /><br />So here&#39;s my review of the Chromecast:<br /><br />  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks good on paper.<br /><br />  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t work when you get it home.<br /><br />Okay, some details.<br /><br />The set-up only has a few steps, but the on-screen directions for one of the steps was so oddly worded that I predict no more than 20% of the general public would be able to decipher it. I stared at it for a few minutes and considered quitting. Eventually I took a guess at what the directions meant and it worked out. Most of the readers of this blog would have guessed right too. To put it in perspective, if you are the type who can buy a wireless router and set it up without help, Chromecast would be easy enough to set up. Otherwise you might need to ask for help.<br /><br />To be fair, the setup is just one poorly-worded instruction away from being genius. And I&#39;m sure by now someone has posted a YouTube video of how to do it.<br /><br />Once Chromecast was up and running, I couldn&#39;t immediately adjust the TV volume because my universal remote didn&#39;t have the TV&#39;s internal speaker volume on its top menu screen. In my house, that means I would be the only one who could figure out how to drill down to the internal speakers menu on the universal remote to adjust volume. If your TV doesn&#39;t have external surround sound speakers, it&#39;s not an issue.<br /><br />I downloaded apps for Netflix and YouTube - which is about all I can do with Chromecast and my iPhone - and waited for the system to not work, because that&#39;s how this sort of thing goes. And sure enough, the pattern held. The apps would lock up on a regular basis. Sometimes the video and the sound didn&#39;t sync. Overall, it didn&#39;t work well enough to trust it for an entire movie.<br /><br />In the few minutes of uninterrupted video and sound I was able to produce through Netflix, I could see the potential of the thing. If it ever worked, it would be fantastic, especially for the price. <br /><br />I was also impressed that I could move the device to another TV and it retained its setup programming, at least within the house where it has the same WiFi. That was handy. <br /><br />Your experience with Chromecast might be different. And I would expect some of the bugs to shake out soon. I like the promise of it. And if you have a teen who likes to watch YouTube clips on a big screen, it could be a great gift. It works well enough for that if you don&#39;t mind the occasional technical problems and freeze-ups.<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Start-up Awareness Enterprise]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/startup_awareness_enterprise/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     800x600   </xml><![endif]-->This is just a mental exercise. I&#39;m not planning to execute the idea I describe below, but it seems as if it would work.<br /><br />Suppose I offer all of you a chance to become partners in a business whose only function is to generate rapid, massive interest in new start-ups that would otherwise have trouble getting attention. In return for our help, we&#39;d ask the start-ups to assign small equity positions to our organization. Each of us would share evenly in the spoils.<br /><br />I (or my minions) would filter through the start-up offers and pick only the ones that appear to have huge potential if the public takes notice. When I mention a start-up on this blog, I&#39;ll ask all members to check it out, download the app, sign up for the service online, and talk it up on social media. I&#39;d only choose start-ups that don&#39;t charge for the basic offering. And I&#39;d try to pick things that seem relevant to all of you.<br /><br />You&#39;d be free to ignore any start-up that looked dumb in your opinion. That way you don&#39;t have to bend your personal ethical standards and recommend something you don&#39;t love. <br /><br />If this business model works, I would expect to attract an ever-growing population of new members to our organization. We don&#39;t want the new recruits diluting our existing equity, so we&#39;ll only give the newbies a share of future business, not past deals. The more people in the group, the more power we&#39;ll have, and the more equity we can ask for. <br /><br />There would be a big free-rider problem with this model. There&#39;s nothing to stop you from signing up and doing nothing to help. So we&#39;d need a way to check that you participate. Perhaps we need our own app that sits between each of you and the sign-up pages for the start-ups. Or maybe we register all of the user names we use for social media (but not our passwords) so the start-ups can cross-reference their customer sign-ups and &quot;likes&quot; against our list. This part of the idea needs work, but seems doable.<br /><br />Would this business model work?<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[About the Bear Thing]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/about_the_bear_thing/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     800x600   </xml><![endif]-->More than a few of you wondered if I wrote the prior post about bears.<br /><br />I did.<br /><br />Was I drunk or on drugs when I did it?<br /><br />No, but that&#39;s a great idea for next time.<br /><br />Was it some sort of social experiment?<br /><br />Well, sort of.<br /><br />My general approach to life goes like this:<br /><br />Try something --&gt; Observe results --&gt; Learn --&gt; Try something else<br /><br />I&#39;m well-suited for drawing comics and writing blog posts because I can erase/delete/adjust a thousand times before the public sees it. I&#39;d be bad at, for example, walking a tightrope across a canyon or doing brain surgery. Those professions don&#39;t respond well to &quot;oops.&quot;<br /><br />I use this blog to practice my writing, try different styles, float ideas, and generally get into the heads of the public. It&#39;s a bad idea in my profession to assume I know what other people want to read. I can only know for sure what is in my own head. And as a general rule, the people who go into my line of work don&#39;t think like normal citizens, for better or worse. So I take a business approach to writing; I test different styles and topics, observe the reactions, and adjust accordingly.<br /><br />With the bear post, I wrote it as a character instead of my normal personality, and imagined the reader being a particular type of person who would drink beer - lots of it - with that character. That&#39;s what produces the different style. And now I know your reactions to it. Thank you.<br /><br />In October you&#39;ll hear a lot about my upcoming non-Dilbert, non-humor, non-fiction book.

<title><![CDATA[Bears: Worst Mammal Ever]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/bears_worst_mammal_ever/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[I hate bears. They&#39;re fat, oversleeping, furry assholes. And can they leave a frickin&#39; picnic basket alone for one minute? I don&#39;t think so. Bears have no emotional intelligence. None.<br /><br />Try petting a bear. That&#39;s a no go. I mean, you can try, but that bear will claw your nads off like they were two blueberries in September. And they will not apologize for that. They&#39;ll just keep pawing through your trash like nothing even happened. Bears don&#39;t give a shit.<br /><br />Speaking of shit, the forest is full of it. That bear you see is 10% bear skin and ninety percent intestines. When a bear eats your potato salad from the campsite, the salad barely has time to turn brown before it&#39;s getting pinched off on some innocent bush in the forest. And what did the bush do to deserve that? Nothing. You don&#39;t see humans do that sort of thing. No human ever says, &quot;I think I&#39;ll drop a deuce on the cat.&quot; We humans respect nature. Bears don&#39;t. They pollute and they don&#39;t give a hoot.<br /><br />And what does a bear do when it has an itchy ass? Does it buy some ointment and suffer silently like a proper mammal, or does it find some majestic redwood tree that is minding its own business and use it as an ass-scratcher? These questions answer themselves, folks.<br /><br />Sometimes you hear of a trained bear in a Russian circus, riding a tiny bicycle, wearing an undersized hat, and you think <em>how cute</em>. But you only hear of those trained bears in Russia. Oh, there&#39;s a reason. It&#39;s because Russian men are not metrosexuals. That bear is actually a guy named Boris who hasn&#39;t trimmed his eyebrows or shaved his back in forty years. The circus doesn&#39;t even pay him. They just hand him a little hat, a little bicycle, and a pitcher of vodka. The rest just happens. So don&#39;t tell me how trainable bears are. While Boris is riding that tiny bike, bears are trying to break into your camper to eat your kids. Bears suck.<br /><br />I&#39;m afraid of anything that sleeps half the year without dying. Bears call it &quot;hibernating&quot; because it sounds better than lazy. That&#39;s nothing but good marketing. Those furry bastards even managed to become California&#39;s mascot, or state animal, or whatever-the-fuck. What kind of message does that send to our kids? If the state mammal can&#39;t get its furry ass out of its den for six months, how are we supposed to get the kids to school by 8 AM? I want my state animal to be a wise owl, or perhaps a porpoise that saves a surfer from a shark. I think I speak for all Californians when I say we don&#39;t want to be associated with bears. It makes the whole state look bad.<br /><br />To make matters worse, after &quot;hibernating,&quot; those lazy bastards spend the next six months, or whatever, eating shit that isn&#39;t even theirs. That&#39;s right: Bears are communists. They do not respect individual property rights. You think you own that ham sandwich on the picnic table? A bear doesn&#39;t think so. <br /><br />I have never trusted bears, and now I hear they are recruiting humans to join their side. In San Francisco, for example, there are men with beards and leather clothing who identify themselves as bears. They act all nice, but after two drinks you won&#39;t believe what they suggest doing. It makes losing a picnic basket sound like a holiday. You might try it a few times just to be polite, but you always find yourself rubbing against a redwood tree afterwards just to make the itching stop. <br /><br />There&#39;s a good reason that Wall Street calls a falling stock market a &quot;bear market.&quot; And when you have a hard time accomplishing something you might say it was a &quot;bear&quot; of a time. You simply don&#39;t see bears associated with happy events. <br /><br />Well, okay, there is one exception. <br /><br />Someone once asked if I had ever had sex on a bearskin rug in front of a fireplace. So I tried it a few times, and I have to say it was great. I guess that&#39;s why the taxidermist keeps the bear&#39;s mouth open in the roaring position. Someday I plan to add a human to the mix and see how the threesome goes.<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[The Power of a Word]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_power_of_a_word/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<strong>Warning:</strong> This blog is written for a rational audience that likes to have fun wrestling with unique or controversial points of view. It is written in a style that can easily be confused as advocacy for one sort of unpleasantness or another. It is not intended to change anyone&#39;s beliefs or actions. If you quote from this post or link to it, which you are welcome to do, please take responsibility for whatever happens if you mismatch the audience and the content.<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />In reaction to my prior post about Trayvon Martin, a reader here named Happy left a comment that is so well-worded I&#39;m going to reproduce it below. The central brilliance of Happy&#39;s writing is that he substituted an unloaded word for a loaded word and it transformed the argument. I even like his choices for line spacing and pacing. And check out the word economy; nothing wasted.<br /><br />I&#39;m not endorsing Happy&#39;s opinion. I&#39;m just impressed by the persuasiveness of his writing. In Happy&#39;s words...<br /><br />&quot;When I buy a can of Coke, I see the label, and I know what to expect.<br /><br />Stereotypes are wrong of course. But brands are good.<br /><br />So if there are a bunch of people that dress a certain way, and act a certain way, they are creating a brand for themselves.<br /><br />There&#39;s a nerd brand. There&#39;s a metro-sexual brand. There&#39;s a jock brand, a cheerleader brand, a gothic brand... I can go on but of course you know what I mean.<br /><br />Then there is a gangster brand.<br /><br />This may be shocking, but if you dress like a gangster - talk like a gangster - and ride around in a car like a gangster, people are bound to pick up on the brand you&#39;re showcasing.<br /><br />I suppose it could be related to race - but I don&#39;t think so. I can have the above stereotypes in any race - no problem.<br /><br />If you want to be treated like a nerd, dress like a nerd. You want to be treated like a gangster, knock yourself out, and dress and act like a bad-ass.<br /><br />But when you do, don&#39;t get upset when people react to the brand you&#39;re pushing.<br /><br />Does that make it right for someone to beat you up because you&#39;re a nerd, or shoot you in cold blood because you look like a gangster? Hell no - of course not.<br /><br />But on the other hand - if you dress like a respectable member of society, the chance of getting treated better is certainly going to be higher.<br /><br />So why bother acting like a bad-ass? <br /><br />I don&#39;t get it.<br /><br />I&#39;m not going to get into the specifics of this case - that&#39;s not the point. The important thing to remember for us and our families is that it&#39;s important to portray the right, positive brand. It won&#39;t hurt to make the world a better place, now will it?<br /><br />So put away the gangster image. Don&#39;t do it - and don&#39;t let your family do it. The world will be a better place for it.&quot;<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Someone famous once said, &quot;You&#39;re not a writer until a writer tells you you&#39;re a writer.&quot; You&#39;re a writer, Happy. But I suspect you already do that for a living.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     800x600   </xml><![endif]--><strong>Warning:</strong> This blog is written for a rational audience that likes to have fun wrestling with unique or controversial points of view. It is written in a style that can easily be confused as advocacy for one sort of unpleasantness or another. It is not intended to change anyone&#39;s beliefs or actions. If you quote from this post or link to it, which you are welcome to do, please take responsibility for whatever happens if you mismatch the audience and the content.<br />  -------------<br /><br />It&#39;s hard to measure this sort of thing, but I nominate the Trayvon Martin protests as the least effective protests in modern history. They might qualify as some sort of world record. And that is a tragedy on top of a tragedy.<br /><br />You can Google Trayvon Martin if you&#39;re not familiar with the case. I assume it&#39;s not getting much coverage overseas. <br /><br />My understanding of the Trayvon Martin protests is that the participants would like the public to stop believing that young African-American males are crime-prone. The strategy for accomplishing this involves holding largely peaceful protests in which a small number of young African-American males are likely to be filmed by news crews wearing masks, breaking store windows, threatening innocent motorists, and getting arrested. That&#39;s exactly what I watched on the news last night as Oakland was starting to heat up.<br /><br />The trouble-makers are a small percentage of the protesters - maybe 1%. The problem is that the 1% gets the lion&#39;s share of news coverage, thus reinforcing the racial bias that the peaceful protesters are trying to combat. In terms of managing the public&#39;s impressions, the protests are an epic fail.<br /><br />On a related topic, I&#39;m fascinated by the way humans reflexively group things. In this case, most observers see this as a racial situation: black versus non-black. And yet no one believes Zimmerman would have made the same boneheaded moves if he had seen an African-American woman in his neighborhood instead of a man. Or an African-American child at age ten. Or even a middle-aged black dude in a sweater-vest. The fact that Trayvon was young and male was at least half of what made him seem suspicious to Zimmerman, one presumes.<br /><br />As a male who was once young, I can confirm that most of my offenses against humanity happened in my early years. My testosterone was high and my frontal lobes were only partly formed. That&#39;s a recipe for trouble, and I caused my fair share. I also grew out of it, right on schedule.<br /><br />The most effective type of protest I can imagine after the Trayvon Martin verdict would involve demands for greater science literacy. That sort of movement doesn&#39;t attract too many vandals and it effectively puts racists in the &quot;ignorant&quot; box instead of the &quot;evil&quot; box. That&#39;s a game-changer. In the year 2013, perhaps the African-American community needs fewer leaders who are ministers and more who are scientists. Just a thought.<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[New Hiring Methods]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/new_hiring_methods/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     800x600   </xml><![endif]-->I keep reading that the big tech companies, most notably Google and Facebook, are finding that job performance isn&#39;t highly correlated to an employee&#39;s college grades or even the reputation of the school attended. And I also understand that tech companies are less inclined to ask interview questions such as &quot;Why are manhole covers round?&quot; Apparently the answers to those questions don&#39;t predict future employee success.<br /><br />So now Google and Facebook and perhaps others are using secret new methods of collecting information on the Internet to identify great candidates they can poach from other companies.<br /><br />BEEP BEEP BEEP<br /><br />Sorry, my bullshit detector just went off.<br /><br />I think what is really going on is that employee success in the tech industry is most correlated with luck. But if you work in Human Resources, and your job involves identifying good employees before they do something great, you need some sort of flavorful bullshit to make it seem as if there is science to what you do. Whenever I hear that someone has a secret algorithm, or they discovered something while data mining, I get highly suspicious.<br /><br />In my experience, people who managed to get good grades from prestigious schools are indeed far more effective than people who didn&#39;t. I expect a Stanford grad to do be smarter and more effective than a Chico State grad at least 80% of the time. <br /><br />But there have also been studies showing that the worst kind of work group is one that has too many smart people. Ideally, you want one smart person and several competent followers on a team, or so the studies suggest. So it doesn&#39;t surprise me that Google or Facebook could be hiring geniuses and experiencing project gridlock as the brainiacs stand around arguing. So that might be the problem.<br /><br />I wonder how anyone can identify a great employee working for another company when that employee has only worked on teams. Often it is the team dynamic, the timing of the project, the chemistry of the group, the effectiveness of management, and a hundred other factors that create success. Most of it looks like luck.<br /><br />I can see how a &quot;Moneyball&quot; approach works in the limited case of baseball. A batter is a member of a team, but the team has little influence on how he hits. A player&#39;s batting average is all about his own skill. But how do you evaluate, for example, an employee whose every move is part of a larger collaborative effort? You can&#39;t moneyball that.<br /><br />I think the secret sauce that makes some groups successful is the chemistry of the team, along with luck, of course. And, as I mentioned, good team chemistry might mean having one smart person and several followers. The problem is implementing that system. Could a manager really get away with organizing teams by brightness level? &quot;Okay, team. Susan is the smart one and the rest of you are . . . the other ones. Go do something awesome.&quot;<br /><br />  &nbsp;<br /><br />  &nbsp;<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Apparently the economy in California is doing well. My personal economic indicator revolves around how hard it is to buy ordinary goods and services. At the moment it is very hard.<br /><br />For starters, the lines everywhere are longer, and the traffic is notably worse than a few years ago. If you can get to a physical store, they don&#39;t have your size in stock, or the popular model is already sold out. At best, the salesperson might try to order your item from another store if you can wait a week. With the exception of grocery stores and pharmacies, physical stores are empty shells waiting for the Internet to deliver a head shot.<br /><br />Apple stores are exceptions. They generally seem to have every model in stock and the staff is excellent. But I won&#39;t buy anything at an Apple store this summer because I&#39;m quite certain they have new and better stuff coming soon. Apple trained me not to buy their products today if they might come out with something better soon, and they are always coming out with something better soon. I&#39;ve been staring at my old and defective iPad for six months wishing there was something I could do about it.<br /><br />Online shopping isn&#39;t much better. Let&#39;s say I realize I need to replace some sort of broken item in my house, which is a process that happens a lot. So I go to a web page that carries that product and use the contact link to find the email address for the company. I type out a simple question about the product and wait for a response.<br /><br />And it never comes.<br /><br />What kind of company doesn&#39;t bother answering a customer who already has his credit card in his hand? Answer: One that has too much business already.<br /><br />Buying clothes online works unless you want a size that fits. Those sizes are generally not available, even online, which I find puzzling. And if heather grey and navy blue aren&#39;t your colors, you&#39;re usually out of luck.<br /><br />And what&#39;s up with taking two weeks to deliver an item you purchased online? Which part of the supply chain is doing so well they can&#39;t keep up with the business?<br /><br />I hired a locksmith recently to fix a broken bathroom door locking mechanism. He worked on it over the course of three separate days, including trips back to headquarters to get parts. When he was done, he proudly showed his work. The door handles were back on the door and functioning! The only problem was that the door would never again lock, because he didn&#39;t have the right parts for that. He&#39;s a locksmith who doesn&#39;t think the &quot;locking&quot; part of a bathroom door is terribly important. Apparently his boss was having a hard time hiring qualified employees. That was a bad situation for me, but a good sign for the economy.<br /><br />I realize this is all anecdotal, but how hard are you finding it to buy normal goods and services compared to a year or two ago?<br /><br />  <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Snowden Dilemma]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/snowden_dilemma/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     800x600   </xml><![endif]-->Suppose the government of the United States gets its hands on Edward Snowden and brings him to trial. Have you wondered what happens then?<br /><br />I&#39;ve predicted that no jury of Snowden&#39;s peers will convict him, regardless of how clear it is that he broke laws. I would be highly disappointed in my fellow citizens if they sided with the perpetrator (the government) over the victims (themselves) and decided to screw the whistleblower (Snowden) who is on their side. But let&#39;s consider the alternative.<br /><br />If Snowden gets convicted, many of the citizens of the United States will go all Egyptian and take to the streets. It was bad enough that the government was collecting all of our private communications. But convicting the guy who blew the whistle? That&#39;s throwing a match on the gasoline. So I believe the government doesn&#39;t want to see him convicted, or at least the top people don&#39;t. It&#39;s too risky to the system.<br /><br />On the other hand, the government has an absolute legal obligation to pursue criminal charges against Snowden. Society doesn&#39;t work if people think they can break laws whenever they have good reasons. <br /><br />We also know there is big money involved in domestic surveillance. And while I&#39;m late to the party on this, all evidence suggests that the government is controlled by corporate interests. So one presumes the government needs to punish the whistleblower to satisfy its corporate overlords and to keep the domestic surveillance cash cow mooing.<br /><br />This puts the government in the awkward position of trying to avoid some sort of accidental competence that ends up convicting a martyr and sparking a popular uprising. They need to put Snowden on trial to satisfy their corporate sponsors. But they need to fail in getting a conviction to satisfy the public. <br /><br />I think there is a 100% chance that some dark department of the government, along with its foreign proxies, is planning an &quot;accident&quot; for Snowden before he reaches the United States. Putin would probably do it in return for secret concessions. He might need some of his own spies freed, for example. In the end, I don&#39;t think the U.S. government will authorize a hit on Snowden because it would be too obvious. But you know they discussed it. That much seems certain.<br /><br />If I were President Obama, I would start seeding the media with the idea of a trial and conviction followed by a presidential pardon. You&#39;d want to float that idea and see what the public thought of it. A conviction and a pardon are as close as you can get to a &quot;tie&quot; in this situation, and that would be the best case scenario for the public. We want to know that lawbreakers are dealt with, but we also appreciate justice.<br /><br />If Snowden gets a lot of attention during a trial, and somehow gains his freedom at the end, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see him run for President in a few years. This is the sort of situation that gives a person instant legitimacy. If Snowden ran on a platform of exposing corporate control over the government and preserving individual privacy he&#39;d be a credible player on day one.<br /><br />Things will get interesting when Snowden reaches our shores, and I&#39;m fairly sure that will happen.<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Slippery Slope to Freedom]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/slippery_slope_to_freedom/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[Some politician - and it doesn&#39;t matter which one - recently said that allowing gays to marry is a slippery slope to the day when assholes like him no longer have the power to tell you how to live your personal life. At least that&#39;s how I heard it.<br /><br />Actually, I think he said something about gay marriage leading to *GASP* polygamy. And so I asked myself what&#39;s wrong with polygamy, assuming there aren&#39;t any child brides and cult overtones? I couldn&#39;t come up with an argument against keeping polygamy illegal. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever heard one.<br /><br />Polygamy always gets conflated in the media with some sort of child-endangering, brainwashing, cultish pit of evil. But what if polygamy is just, for example, two dudes and one woman who work well as a trio? How does that hurt anyone?<br /><br />Employee benefits, such as healthcare, would need to be adjusted in a polygamous world. You can&#39;t have one worker automatically qualifying for employee-paid healthcare for seven spouses. But that sort of thing is easy to tidy-up with legislation.<br /><br />If anyone knows of an argument against polygamy, based on science as opposed to holy books, please let me know in the comments. And remember that polygamy can include one woman with multiple husbands. And just to keep things clean, assume the polygamous arrangement is based on practicality and not a religious belief.<br /><br />This line of thinking made me wonder how one might organize society if there were no laws, customs and culture already in place. In other words, if no one had ever heard of traditional marriage with two people at the head of a nuclear family, what would be the most natural way to organize society? Are traditional marriage and polygamy even in the top five options?<br /><br />I remember reading that people in arranged marriages were just as happy as those who married for love. That says a lot. And so I wonder: If you looked at every human society, past and present, and studied their marriage and social organization, would you find one model that just sticks out as working best? And what would it be?<br /><br />Who knows the answer to that?<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/snowden/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     800x600   </xml><![endif]-->The Edward Snowden case has been fascinating from the start. It has spy stuff, a man on the run, embarrassing government secrets, international gamesmanship, a model girlfriend, legal maneuvering. Wow.<br /><br />But you haven&#39;t seen anything yet. Snowden isn&#39;t running and he isn&#39;t hiding; he&#39;s waiting. And he&#39;s reportedly <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/28/edward-snowden-nbc-today-show-nsa-return-home-traitor/2471273/">negotiating </a>the terms of his return through his dad. When he&#39;s ready, and it&#39;s safe, he&#39;ll come after the U.S. government in a public trial. He&#39;s the real deal. And he&#39;s on your side, even if it doesn&#39;t feel that way.<br /><br />Is he a traitor? Yes, absolutely. But so were Washington, Adams, Hamilton, Franklin, and Jefferson, to name a few. If you think being a traitor is always bad, no matter the circumstances or motives, you&#39;re officially too dumb to vote.<br /><br />I&#39;m wondering how you find a jury that would convict Snowden. On the first day of the trial his lawyer will explain to all twelve jurors how the government spied on them personally. Every potential juror is also a victim. Good luck getting the victims to side with the perpetrator, which in this case is the government. <br /><br />I think there&#39;s some sort of law that says I can&#39;t make a public statement in favor of jury nullification. Jury nullification is when jurors agree that the accused broke the law, but they feel the law itself is wrong, or that a conviction would be overkill, so they find the accused innocent. I predict that will happen. I don&#39;t recommend jury nullification because I&#39;m not sure I have freedom of speech in this regard. I simply predict that nullification will happen.<br /><br />My personal view is that if the government had asked citizens for permission to collect all communications in the country, or had stated its intentions without asking for permission, I&#39;d be okay with it. It seems like a great tool for combatting domestic terrorism, and I don&#39;t think the government cares about my browser history. <br /><br />But the government didn&#39;t ask my opinion before it collected my personal communications data. I can&#39;t give a free pass for that. And I am available for jury duty.<br /><br />  &nbsp;<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[The Paula Deen Context]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_paula_deen_context/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     800x600   </xml><![endif]-->  <strong>Warning:</strong> This blog is written for a rational audience that likes to have fun wrestling with unique or controversial points of view. It is written in a style that can easily be confused as advocacy for one sort of unpleasantness or another. It is not intended to change anyone&#39;s beliefs or actions. If you quote from this post or link to it, which you are welcome to do, please take responsibility for whatever happens if you mismatch the audience and the content.<br /><br />&nbsp;------<br /><br />I hadn&#39;t heard of Paula Deen, the so-called Southern cooking star, until her recent string of &quot;controversies.&quot; Now I&#39;m all in. This is one of the most interesting stories in a long time, from a psychology point of view.<br /><br />I was casually following the headlines last year when it came out that Deen was promoting less-than-healthy food while she developed Type 2 diabetes, presumably from eating similar crap, while secretly negotiating a promotional deal with Novartis to pimp their diabetes drug. None of that sounds good.<br /><br />The diabetes issue got her on the front page. But the recent &quot;racism&quot; controversy has pretty much ended her career, I would expect. That stain doesn&#39;t go away.<br /><br />So I thought I would wade in and offer some context because I haven&#39;t gotten myself in enough trouble lately. My personal view of Deen, based on incomplete knowledge, is that she was a product of her environment, just like the rest of us. She did things she rightfully regrets, was honest about it and took responsibility, learned from her experiences, apologized in ways that looked sincere to me, and evolved. Hollywood makes movies about that sort of thing: Flawed person learns lessons the hard way. So now that Deen and her critics are on the same side, in terms of both healthy eating and race, that&#39;s the end of the story, right? <br /><br />Not in this world. And that&#39;s the part that fascinates me.<br /><br />I was watching some low-budget entertainment show the other night on which so-called &quot;media personality&quot; Keli Goff was ripping Deen apart while grinning in a most disturbing way. Goff, if you don&#39;t already know, is your signal that something is wrong with the context of a story. She&#39;s associated with the bottom-feeding media that includes The Huffington Post and the like. Those outlets don&#39;t just report the news; they create it by leaving out context. So, when I saw Goff, I got interested. And I wasn&#39;t disappointed.<br /><br />The show I watched went like this. The host played a clip of Deen issuing an emotional, raw, awkward apology that literally included begging for forgiveness. The host and the pundits talked about Deen&#39;s apology at length. Five minutes later, on the same show, with the same pundits, the conversation turned to Deen&#39;s lack of an apology, as if they had not just watched and discussed that very thing.<br /><br />Let me repeat that. They played a tape of Deen&#39;s apology, discussed the apology then complained that there had been no apology. I watched carefully to see if they meant the apology was lacking a necessary element, but that didn&#39;t seem to be the case. The apology looked sincere and heartfelt to me, albeit awkward. The problem, said the pundits, was that the very thing they just watched and discussed didn&#39;t actually happen. You rarely see confirmation bias play out that vividly. Once it had been decided that Deen was a monster, it couldn&#39;t also be true that she issued a sincere apology even if you just finished watching it. The whole thing was fascinating.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know what is in Deen&#39;s soul, and I certainly don&#39;t know all the facts behind the allegations, so I neither support nor defend her. But I&#39;d like to add some context because the bottom-feeding media is doing the opposite.<br /><br />  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every alleged example of Deen&#39;s racism involves either a good friend of hers who is African-American, an African-American chef or general manager that she or her brother hired for their restaurants, and in one case a preference for hiring African-American servers for a particular event. (More on that later.) That&#39;s a strange pattern for a racist. <br /><br />  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I owned two restaurants. Restaurants are unusually fertile breeding grounds for bogus lawsuits and employment claims. You can&#39;t compare restaurants to other businesses in that way. You should assume 90% of employee discrimination claims in the restaurant industry are complete bullshit even if the stats are opposite in the standard corporate world. That&#39;s the context in which you should view the employee claims against Deen. Remember, she&#39;s an easy target, and any lawyer would know she has deep pockets and a need to settle quickly. I don&#39;t know the facts in her case, nor do you. I&#39;m just giving context.<br /><br />  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deen claims her use of the N-word was in the context of jokes long ago and not representative of her current thinking. I don&#39;t know where her critics grew up, but during my youth in upstate New York it seemed as if all jokes were at the expense of one ethnic group or another, blonde women, farmer&#39;s daughters, lepers, dead babies, and folks with disabilities. The wrongness of the so-called humor was the whole point. That was the style of the day, as despicable as it seems by today&#39;s standards. When Deen admits to being part of that culture, and evolving out of it, that sounds more like na&iuml;ve honesty than racism. If you didn&#39;t live through that era, you are missing some important context.<br /><br />  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most damning allegations is that Deen once suggested a slave-themed event that would feature only professional servers who were African-American. To me that sounds laughably implausible. It&#39;s the sort of thing one could only believe if you already bought into the idea that Deen is a racist, diabetes-promoting monster. It reminds me of the recent Internet hoax showing a photo of Heineken banners over a dog fight. A lot of folks on the Internet believed Heineken was advertising at a dog fight, as if that was even slightly plausible.

<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/fascinating_skunk_fight/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[Over at The <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/06/17/the-saga-of-scott-adams-scrotum/comment-page-1/#comment-638528">Bearded Taint&#39;s blog</a>, the citizens have lit torches, grabbed pitchforks and come after me (again). I don&#39;t think I have seen more concentrated hate in one place. It&#39;s actually quite fascinating from a mental health perspective.<br /><br />I left my own comments on the Bearded Taint&#39;s blog if you want to follow along.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that I&#39;m reasonably sure my haters and I have exactly the same opinions on the topics they are getting worked up about. But once the Internet decides you are a holocaust-denying, creationist, science-hating, sexist, sock puppet, all evidence seems to support that view. And in this case, these science-loving folks are basing their views on rumors, stuff taken out of context, misinterpretations, faulty memory of stuff they once read but don&#39;t fully remember, and that sort of thing.<br /><br />I&#39;ll say it again because it is so interesting: The people who are hating me because of my opinions have exactly the same opinions. They just don&#39;t realize it because of the fog of confirmation bias.<br /><br />I&#39;m totally guilty of blogging in a way that was guaranteed to get this sort of reaction. I&#39;ll own that. I think there is an audience for people who are willing to play with ideas and not take any of it too seriously. The problem is that I become a target for advocates who need well-known enemies, manufactured or real. But I do understand that is part of my chosen profession. It&#39;s more fascinating than annoying. I love watching normally rational people get spun out of their minds by The Bearded Taint and his type.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[The Internet Fingerprint]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_internet_fingerprint/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[My hypothesis is that science will someday be able to identify sociopaths and terrorists by their patterns of Facebook and Internet use. I&#39;ll bet normal people interact with Facebook in ways that sociopaths and terrorists couldn&#39;t duplicate.<br /><br />Anyone can post fake photos and acquire lots of friends who are actually acquaintances. But I&#39;ll bet there are so many patterns and tendencies of &quot;normal&quot; use on Facebook that a terrorist wouldn&#39;t be able to successfully fake it.<br /><br />The main reason you can&#39;t fake Facebook use patterns is that you can&#39;t control how others respond to you. Good friends respond entirely differently than acquaintances, both in quantity and content. I think that sort of difference would show up.<br /><br />Years ago, during my banking career, a coworker developed a program that looked through bank records for patterns suggesting possible fraud. It worked well enough that he formed his own company, sold the program to banks, and became a wealthy man. The key to the program&#39;s success is that crooks don&#39;t know there is a normal pattern and so they don&#39;t know when they violate it. I think the same would be true for Facebook. There must be dozens of normal Facebook patterns that sociopaths and terrorists wouldn&#39;t know about, and therefore couldn&#39;t fake.<br /><br />I imagine that Internet usage patterns could tell experts as much about your brain as an MRI. To put it in simpler terms, if you tell me which web pages you browsed this week, I can come up with a good estimate of your odds of being a terrorist.<br /><br />Do you think the government is already monitoring your Internet use pattern, if not the specific pages? If not, they will.<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Blurb Your Way to Fame]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/blurb_your_way_to_fame/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[Before you take on any challenge - whether you are planning a trip to someplace exotic, or contemplating a career change, or whatever - there is always a step you will do first if it is available to you: You&#39;ll ask other people how they did it. You probably won&#39;t follow the same playbook as those who went before, but knowing how others approached the same challenge, and how it turned out, will narrow your choices. And that can help a lot.<br /><br />After Dilbert became a big deal, people started asking how I was able to beat such long odds. Was it simply a case of hard work plus extraordinary luck, or did I have some sort of secret method?<br /><br />The interesting answer is that my career unfolded according to a written strategy that I created after I graduated from college. I still have it. And on top of the strategy I have several systems designed to make it easier for luck to find me. <br /><br />Last year I realized that my personal story has just the right amount of twists and setbacks to make good reading. So I turned it into a book that will come out in October on the topic of success. The title is <em>How to Fail Almost Every Time and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life.</em> It&#39;s a non-Dilbert book that includes humor in some chapters, but it&#39;s mostly a very different approach to the topic of success. I wouldn&#39;t expect anyone to follow my systems and get the same results, but I think it is helpful to know which methods other people have tried and how it turned out for them.<br /><br />Anyway, my publisher asked me about getting blurbs for the back cover. In publishing lingo, a blurb is a recommendation or positive review of the book that appears on the back cover, as in &quot;A fantastic read. I couldn&#39;t put it down. - Joe Blow.&quot;<br /><br />My problem with collecting blurbs in the usual way is that it feels like assigning homework to strangers. A typical blurb process might involve picking some famous authors in the success field and asking my publisher to ask their publishers to ask the famous authors to 1) Read my book, and 2) Write glowing reviews. The whole process feels wrong.<br /><br />This is where you come in.<br /><br />My publisher has agreed to print blurbs from you, my blog readers, knowing that none of you have read the actual book. What&#39;s in it for you is that you might see your name on the back cover of the book. <br /><br />The trick is to write your review in a way that addresses my general writing/thinking qualities as seen on this blog. You won&#39;t be reviewing the book so much as reviewing me as a writer. Keep your reviews to a few sentences at most, and don&#39;t be so overboard that it looks disingenuous. The trick is to say something positive that isn&#39;t over the top. And don&#39;t pretend you actually read the book.<br /><br />I&#39;ll select several winners from what I see in the comments and stick them on the book.<br /><br />Who&#39;s in?<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Open Source Architecture]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/open_source_architecture/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     800x600   </xml><![endif]-->Thanks to reader JP for this link about a plan for <a href="http://thefutureofthings.com/news/11598/open-source-house-building.html">open-source home architecture.</a><br /><br />If the plan works, someday a consumer will be able to download buildable home construction plans and order custom-cut materials to make home-building a breeze, and much cheaper. The biggest obstacle will be the complexity of local building standards. But I can imagine local governments embracing the system if it allows them to input their unique building requirements into it as a filter. It might be a big money-saver for the town because every proposed building plan that comes through the system will already meet codes.<br /><br />The thing that is missing from the downloadable architecture system, as far as I know, is the design element. I don&#39;t want to build a house that is nothing but a bunch of boring rectangles arranged over a foundation. I want a house that is designed with function in mind first. And for that I&#39;d like to see some sort of &quot;best design&quot; subsection for the downloadable home plans.<br /><br />I often think about how hard it was to design our current kitchen layout. Kitchens are a challenge because ideally you want everything to be next to everything else, which is physically impossible. Our biggest error was putting the flatware drawer in a place that guaranteed someone would always be standing in front of it when someone else needed a fork. It seems like a small thing, but design is about getting all of the small stuff right. I&#39;d love to upload the design of our kitchen, after moving that one drawer, and see how it stacks up to other kitchen designs.<br /><br />Current home design is all about appearance over function because consumers buy homes that look great while having a hard time imagining all the little functional flaws such as a lack of storage space, how sound travels, and that sort of thing. The big homebuilders and architects design for the camera, not for the consumer. When homes are designed to meet the best standards of function as voted by actual homeowners, the value of the typical home will skyrocket at the same time the cost of construction drops.<br /><br />I predict that in twenty years nearly every house that exists today will be seen as a &quot;tear down&quot; because new construction will be cheap and new home designs will be extraordinary.<br /><br />Imagine picking your house design over the Internet with the intention of doing much of the work yourself, perhaps with your own crew of helpers. You pick the design, pick the start date, and click BUY. From that point on, the system starts delivering materials according to a fixed schedule that the buyer can modify on the fly. You show up at the construction site in the morning and several Google self-driving delivery trucks are already waiting. Your construction-bot unloads the trucks and stages the building material where you want it.<br /><br />You walk up to the pile of materials and use your smartphone to read the bar code and call up detailed step-by-step directions for what you need to do. You&#39;ll have exactly the tools you need because the system warned you a week ahead to be ready for this phase. If you don&#39;t own a nail gun, for example, that is added to your delivery at the same time as the materials.<br /><br />I can also imagine that in this world of pre-cut materials we would see more of a snap-together building system that is easy for non-handy people to manage.<br /><br />There is an enormous home construction/retrofit phase ahead of us, perhaps ten years out.<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Virtual People]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/virtual_people/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[Let&#39;s say in ten years you have digital glasses such as Google&#39;s Glass. Now let&#39;s say the glasses are Internet connected at high speed and have access to facial recognition software. And let&#39;s say the glasses allow you to replace whatever is in your field of vision with a computer generated image.<br /><br />See where I&#39;m going with this?<br /><br />The implication of this technology is that you could make love to your spouse while wearing the glasses and replacing his/her face with the face of a preferred lover in real time. And I don&#39;t know if you can buy stock in blow-up sex doll companies but this would be a good time to get in on the ground floor. The manufacturer simply needs to color the dolls blue so the glasses can digitally create whoever you would like it to be.<br /><br />Or the glasses could digitally airbrush real people who are standing in front of you. Perhaps software could add a tan or even subtract a few pounds. I would imagine software could find the midpoint of a human and digitally distort the stomach area to make the person&#39;s proportions just right.<br /><br />I can imagine an old-folks care facility in which everyone wears blue clothing and digital glasses that make the residents look like their 20-year old selves. You&#39;d be surrounded by old people but it would look like spring break.<br /><br />Clothing fashion might stop being a thing in the real world because it is easier to change your outfit digitally. You simply transmit your wardrobe code to the observer and that person sees a CGI image of your clothing choice instead of the blue jump suit you are actually wearing. You could have dozens of virtual wardrobe changes in a day. Or you could appear with tattoos and a tongue ring to your young friends while appearing professionally dressed to business associates and family, all at the same time.<br /><br />In the future, a television set might be nothing but a blue rectangle on a wall that has a bar code. Your glasses read the bar code and start transmitting images to you while keeping the images framed as if in the virtual TV on the wall. That way you can look around and not have your entire field of vision blocked by the TV image.<br /><br />One of the worries about Google&#39;s Glass product is that people will hate talking in person to someone who is wearing them. But that is only a problem if one of you has the product and the other doesn&#39;t. In other words, 50% penetration of this product will be a nightmare whereas 100% penetration is fun for all.<br /><br />Therefore, I predict that Google and other big tech companies will give away digital glasses for free someday, so they can skip the 50% nightmare penetration level and go straight to 100%, or near it, where they need to be. The business model will involve selling subscription connections to the Internet and having access to all of the apps and services. And I assume there will be an advertising model. In any case, I would expect digital glasses to go from a novelty item for geeks to a nearly 100% adoption rate within five years of the technology reaching some minimum level of functionality. And that will happen because the glasses will be free. <br /><br />I would imagine that even people with no money could use digital glasses in WiFi hot spots and still have access to the most basic functions without a subscription. So money won&#39;t be much of an obstacle.<br /><br />By the way, I realized yesterday that my generation is the last of the pure humans. Most people my age were raised with no personal technology. Someday historians will mark the smartphone era as the beginning of the Cyborg Age. From this day on, most kids in developed countries will be part human and part machine. As technology improves, we will keep adding it to our bodies. <br /><br />And if that isn&#39;t scary enough, check out the folks trying to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/26/cambrian-genome-compiler/">design new life forms</a> at the DNA level.<br /><br />  &nbsp;<br /><br />  <br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Hiring Versus Firing]]></title>

<description><![CDATA[Imagine a manager who is excellent at identifying and hiring talent but not so good at firing the people who need it. Compare that situation to a manager who does an average job of hiring but is spectacular at weeding out the bad apples in the group. All other things being equal, which manager will do better?<br /><br />Here&#39;s the summary:<br /><br /><strong>Manager 1</strong>: Great at hiring, average at firing<br /><br /><strong>Manager 2</strong>: Great at firing, average at hiring<br /><br />I&#39;m going to cast my vote for the manager who does a better job of firing than hiring. My reasoning is that one can never know for sure who will be a good hire because people are skilled at concealing their personality flaws during interviews. Once hired, people feel free to let their inner assholes out. So hiring is an extraordinarily imprecise process. <br /><br />Firing, on the other hand, is far more objective. Ask any group of employees who among them needs to be fired and most people will turn and point to the same guy. While it&#39;s hard to know who you should hire, it can be easy to know who to fire. The manager who is good at firing only needs the cold-hearted resolve to do it in a timely manner. There generally isn&#39;t much doubt about who should be fired.<br /><br />I also wonder if one person can have the skill to be good at hiring and also good at firing. I would think that knowing who to hire requires a high degree of social empathy. The skilled interviewer makes a connection through conversation and eye contact and &quot;feels&quot; the other person. A manager who is socially talented might pick up little clues from an applicant that others would miss, such as arrogance or deceptiveness or moral flexibility.<br /><br />On the other hand, a manager who is good at firing might be high on the sociopath scale. Where the socially talented manager would find it intolerably painful to look someone in the eye and fire them, the sociopath sees it as just another Tuesday. Common sense tells us the sociopath would pull the trigger sooner and get rid of the bad apples.<br /><br />In my corporate experience, which included perhaps a dozen or more work groups, I never thought to myself that we could do better if only we could hire some superstars. Instead, I always thought we needed to get rid of a few obvious duds and trouble-makers and everything would flow smoothly after that.<br /><br />Keep in mind that I never worked in a group that was inventing the next smartphone or doing anything sexy. We didn&#39;t need geniuses. We just needed to get the work done.<br /><br />Over time, the manager who fires best will end up with top talent through a survival-of-the-fittest process. <br /><br />Obviously I&#39;ve oversimplified things. But if you accept that firing is more critical than hiring, I will move on to my point.<br /><br />Given that firing might be more important than hiring, and given that employees are well-aware of who among them needs to be fired, it suggests a better system. As with most of my ideas, it is entirely impractical but fun to think about.<br /><br />Imagine that instead of managers making firing decisions, only the employees themselves make those decisions as a group. And let&#39;s say the job of managers is to set targets for the number of people in the group who need to be fired by what deadline. For example, if you have a hundred employees in a group, and the group hasn&#39;t performed well, the manager might say 10% have to be voted out of the group by year end. If the group is performing well, the manager might set the target at 5%.<br /><br />In my corporate days I learned that coworkers don&#39;t have much reason to be nice to one another. But you would be nice to anyone who had a vote on your future. You might even be proactive in doing well by your coworkers because that&#39;s the sort of thing that gets remembered at voting time.<br /><br />I realize that managers already take input from employees on what they think of coworkers, but that turns into a lot of he-said, she-said. And coworkers generally don&#39;t say a coworker is toxic even if that is the only word that describes it. Instead, you tell your manager that Bob is spreading rumors, or not returning phone calls, or whatever is the specific crime, and your boss treats it as isolated cases that can surely be managed. A manager will usually give both sides the benefit of the doubt. But if employees make their own collective firing decisions, no manager would be involved to water-down, distort, or delay the process. You simply vote the toxic guy out.<br /><br />There are already a number of companies who set firing targets. But managers are still in charge of execution. And those systems tend to be draconian because the level of firing is independent of the group&#39;s performance.<br /><br />Under my proposed system, in which the manager sets firing targets based on performance, and employees make firing decisions, you create an interesting new dynamic. Under the old system, if my coworker does bad work it is mostly his problem so long as my manager sees me as a good worker. I&#39;ll get my raise even if the other guy doesn&#39;t. Under my system, the group has a collective goal of convincing the manager that the firing level should be set as zero. Employees have a common enemy of sorts in the manager. I would think that would be good for teamwork.<br /><br />What do you think of a system in which managers set firing targets and employees decide who goes?<br /><br />      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";} </style> <![endif]-->]]></description>
