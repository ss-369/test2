The thinking goes something like this, “We need a number to measure how we’re doing. Numbers focus people and help us measure success.” Whilst well intentioned, management by numbers unintuitively leads to problematic behavior and ultimately detracts from broader project and organizational goals. Metrics inherently aren’t a bad thing; just often, inappropriately used. <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/useOfMetrics.html\">This essay</a> demonstrates many of the issues caused by management’s traditional use of metrics and offers an alternative to address these dysfunctions.</p>"

The amount, speed, and value of data sources is rapidly increasing. Data management has to change in five broad areas: extraction of data from a wider range of sources, changes to the logistics of data management with new database and integration approaches, the use of agile principles in running analytics projects, an emphasis on techniques for data interpretation to separate signal from noise, and the importance of well-designed visualization to make that signal more comprehensible. Summing up this means we don’t need big analytics projects, instead we want the new data thinking to permeate our regular work. <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/bigData\">(go to the infodeck)</a></p>"
